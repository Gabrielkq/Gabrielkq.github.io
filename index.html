                <p class="ttext">For my final project in Web Development 100, I took the idea of an image gallery and made it immersive, interactive, and dynamic. Begining with images of different artwork I had created, I designed a virtual room with my artwork on the walls that the user could turn and see view it from different cardinal directions.</p>
                <p class="ttext">I attempted to accomplish this feat using as most CSS as possible, while having the least ammount of images. These CSS commands were not covered in class, and it required much googling, self-directed learning, and quite a bit of trial and error. Eventually, I was able to finagle a semblance of what I had envisioned.</p>
                <p class="ttext">Here is a visualization of how I got it to work, starting from the images with their original placement, size, and shape.  The room is then assembled into a proper one-point perspective, with the all CSS transformations being ANIMATED, with custom cubic-bezier timing on an infinite and reversing loop.</p>
                <p class="ttext">A miniturized screenshot of the final room is directly above for reference.</p>
                <p> this is a change to show updating for git push <p>
