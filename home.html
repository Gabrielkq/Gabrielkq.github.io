    <p>
      My first overzealous collapsing jumbotron image gallery attempt can be found on the <a href="art.html">Art</a> page. However, because I wanted to use my own artwork of varying sizes, it does have a staggered herky jerky feel to the grid of images.
    </p>

    <p>So, in keeping with the ethos and credo of "Team Too Much", I did ANOTHER image gallery, not linked on the nav bar above. This more simplistic gallery, with images of roughly the same size, has a more a more uniform feel to the grid. This straight
      basic bitch style can be found <a href="baby.html">here.</a> And in keeping with the mayonaise styling, I of course used images of baby animals. </p>
